\section{Needle Path Planning}
\noindent \textbf{Optimization Model}
The trajectory is discretized into time intervals $\mathcal{T} = \{0,1,\ldots,T\}$.



$\mathcal{T} \in [0, 1, \ldots, \mathcal{T}]$.
At each time step the needle's pose is parametrized as
$X_t = \begin{bmatrix}
    R_t & p_t \\ 0^T & 1
\end{bmatrix} \in SE(3)$
where $R_t \in SO(3)$ is a rotation matrix and
$ p_t \in  \mathbb{R}^3 $ is a position.

The control input is parametrized by the needle's radius $r_k$ and the distance $\Delta$, by which the needle is inserted at each time step. We note that $r_k$ is chosen from a discrete set available needle radii. And while $\Delta$ can be selected to be different for each time step, prior empirical results show that the optimization result in uneven distribution of $\Delta$ at each time step resulting undesirable trajectories.
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
& \underset{\mathcal{X},\, r_k,\, \Delta}{\text{minimize}}
& & \alpha_\Delta \mathcal{C}_\Delta \\
& \text{subject to}
& & f_{collision}(\mathcal{X}_t, \mathcal{O}) > d_{safe}, & \forall t  \\
& & & curve(\mathcal{X}_{t+1}, \mathcal{X}_t) = r_k, & \forall t  \\
& & & \|p_i-p_1\|_2^2 < \epsilon \\
& & & \|p_f-p_T\|_2^2 < \epsilon \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The above formulation results in smooth trajectories of constant curvature that
avoid obstacles and pass through the needle entry and exit points. We use the
signed distance between each point in the trajectory and the incision mesh to
check for collision. The needle path is constrained to a constant curvature to
minimize tissue deformation and damage.

\subsection{\textbf{Re-parametrization of Pose Constraints}}
Generating collision-free, constant curvature trajectories in 3D space is challenging because it requires planning in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D, i.e. $SE(3)$ configuration space.
SE(3) is a semidirect product of Special Orthogonal Group (SO(3)) and $\mathbb{R}^3$. Using homogeneous coordinates, we can represent SE(3) as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
SE(3) &= \left\{
\begin{bmatrix}
R & p \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\in GL(4) \rvert R \in SO(3), t \in R^3 \right\}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\noindent The action of an element $g \in SE(3)$ on a point $p \in \mathbb{R}^3$ is given by
$g = \begin{bmatrix}
R & p \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
\quad g \cdot p = Rp + t $.

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% g &=
% \begin{bmatrix}
% R & p \\
% 0 & 1
% \end{bmatrix} \\
% & g \cdot p = Rp + t
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

Trajectory optimization methods that use sequential convex optimization, iteratively update a trajectory until the all the problem constraints are satisfied and objective function reaches a local minimum. However, optimization directly over the trajectory in pose representation (homogeneous coordinates in our case) can lead to poor results and slow convergence rates.

Rotation parametrizations such as quaternions or rotation matrices are over-constrained and can cause the optimization to be numerically unstable iterating over degenerate solutions.
While on the other hand, axis angle representations have the correct number of degrees of freedom but deformation at the poles of the configuration space severely slows down convergence.

Since $SE(3)$ is a differentiable manifold, we can instead optimize over the manifold using the corresponding Lie algebra, $\mathfrak{se}(3)$, which is defined as the tangent vector space at the identity of SE(3). An excellent introduction in lie algebraic approach in pose registration in provided by~\citet{Agrawal2006Lie}.

\noindent The Lie algebra of $SE(3)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \mathfrak{se}(3) = \left\{
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \hat{\omega} & u \\
        0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \in GL(4) \rvert \hat{\omega}\in so(3), u \in \mathbb{R}^3
    \right\}
\end{equation}

\noindent Here $\hat{\omega}$ is the skew symmetric form of the rotation vector
$\omega = (\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z)^T$ and is an element of the Lie algebra for $SO(3)$
\begin{equation}
    \hat{\omega} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & -\omega_z & \omega_y  \\
        \omega_z & 0 & -\omega_x \\
        -\omega_y & \omega_x & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

\noindent The logarithm map $SE(3) \to \mathfrak{se}(3)$ is given by:
\begin{equation}
    \text{log}\left(
        \begin{bmatrix}
            R & t \\
            0 & 1
        \end{bmatrix}
    \right)  =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        log(R) & A^{-1}t \\
        0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:logMap}
\end{equation}

\noindent where
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
    A^{-1} &= I - \frac{1}{2}\hat{\omega} +
\frac{2\sin\|\omega\| - \|\omega\|(1+cos\|\omega\|) }{2\omega^{2} \sin\|\omega\|}\hat{\omega}^{2},  \\
log(R) &= \frac{\phi}{2sin(\phi)}\big(R - R^T\big) \equiv \hat{\omega}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
and $\phi$ satisfies $Tr(R) = 1+2cos(\phi), \quad |\phi|<\pi$.
\vspace{5pt}
\noindent The matrix exponential to map $\mathfrak{se}(3) \to SE(3)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \text{exp}\left(
        \begin{bmatrix}
            \hat{\omega} & u \\
            0 & 0
        \end{bmatrix}
    \right)  =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \text{exp}(\hat{\omega}) & Au \\
        0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \label{eq:expMap}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\text{exp}(\hat{\omega})$ can be computed with Rodrigue's formula:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{exp}(\hat{\omega}) &= I + \frac{1-\cos(\|\omega\|)}{\|\omega\|}\hat{\omega}^2 +
    \frac{\sin(\|\omega\|)}{\|\omega\|^2}\hat{\omega},\\
    A &= I + \frac{1-\cos(\|\omega\|)}{\|\omega\|^2}\hat{\omega} + \frac{\|\omega\| - \sin\|\omega\|}{\|\omega\|^3}\hat{\omega}^2
\end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

With equations \eqref{eq:logMap} and \eqref{eq:expMap}, we can convert an element in SE(3) to $\mathfrak{se}(3)$ and vice-versa. Furthermore, we can also \todo{Jacobians}

\subsection{Suturing Best-Practice for Initialization}
\todo{rephrase and quantify}
There are many general rules that surgeons use to complete
a suture. A typical list of such rules is below [10] [11].
Manual needle sutures normally result in a picture similar to
Fig. 1.
1. The needle first “bites” the tissue orthogonally. By
inserting the needle such that the tip is orthogonal to
the tissue surface, tissue surface stress is minimized.
2. The wrench between the tissue and the needle during
the suture must be minimized. Minimizing the needle
tissue interaction force reduces the internal tissue stress,
and consequently reduces additional tissue trauma due
to the suture.
3. The re-grippable length of the needle during the
suture must be adequate for the needle re-grasp to be
completed successfully. Since the needle holder can
not be inserted through the tissue, there must be an
intermediate point during the suture that the gripper can
regrasp the needle on the tip to complete the suture.
4. The final depth of the needle in the tissue is an
important component of a successful suture. The actual
target depth is determined by many factors, including
both the wound being closed and the size of the needle.
5. The needle tip should only touch the tissue at the
insertion site. Similarly, the needle gripper should not
place unnecessary stress on the tissue.
The above list is not exhaustive, but details important components
of a quality suture.
Converting the listed suture principles into a list of analytic
equations allows for the planning algorithm to be automated
and optimized against the suture guidelines.
